      <p>
        Welcome! My name is <b className="name-title">John Murphy</b>, and I'm
        excited to share a little bit about myself. I am a graduate from the
        University of Central Florida, where I earned both my Bachelor's and
        Master's degrees in Computer Science. During my time as a graduate
        student, I specialized in Machine Learning, dedicating countless hours
        to honing my skills and becoming a professional Data Scientist.
        <p>
          While my expertise lies in the field of AI and Machine Learning, I
          have also delved into the world of web development. In fact, I had the
          opportunity to work extensively on web development projects during my
          role as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University. This
          experience allowed me to expand my knowledge and proficiency in
          creating custom websites using frameworks like React.js. I am
          passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems
          and enhance user experiences. Whether it's developing cutting-edge AI
          algorithms or crafting intuitive web interfaces, I strive for
          excellence in every project I undertake. As I embark on this journey
          to secure my first job, I am eager to apply my skills, knowledge, and
          passion to contribute to a forward-thinking organization. I look
          forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring
          opportunities that align with my expertise. Thank you for visiting my
          website, and please feel free to explore further to learn more about
          my projects and experiences.
